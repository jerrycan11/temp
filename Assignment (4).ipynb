Assessment was framed by DCIT, \\nCir-57, Kolkata u/s 201(1)/201(1A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred \\nto as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) for AY 2009-10 vide its order dated 12.11.2009.  Penalty was imposed \\nby  Addl.CIT  (TDS),  Range-57,  Kolkata  u/s.  271C  of  the  Act  vide  his  order  dated \\n01.02.2010.  \\n\\n The only issue in this appeal of revenue is against the order of CIT(A) deleting \\n2. \\nthe penalty levied by Addl.CIT(TDS) u/s. 271C of the Act for failure/short deduction \\nof  TDS u/s194-D of the Act as against deducted by assessee u/s 194-C of the Act.  For \\nthis, revenue has raised following two grounds:  \\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1. On the facts and circumstances of the case Ld. CIT(A) was not justified in deleting \\nthe penalty of Rs.8,80,89,883/- imposed u/s. 271C though the deductor could not deny \\nthe fact it failed to deduct tax and deposit to Govt. account.  \\n \\n 2. On the facts and circumstances of the case Ld. CIT(a) was not justified in deleting the \\npenalty imposed u/s. 271C though the Apex Court has clear verdict in the judgment in \\nthe case  of  Union  of  India  Vs.  Dharmendra Textiles Processors  (2008)  306  ITR  277 \\n(SC) that willful concealment is not an essential ingredient for attracting civil liability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\nBriefly stated and undisputed facts are that a survey u/s. 133A of the Act was \\n3. \\nconducted  on  the  business  premises  of  the  assessee,  which  is  corporate  agent  of \\nReliance  Life Insurance Co.  Ltd.  (in  short RLICL).    The  assessee  is  engaged in  the \\nbusiness  of  insurance  and  in  lieu  of  work  it  receives  insurance  commission.    The \\n\\n\\x0c2 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nassessee in order to carry out work entered into agreement with Global Trust Financial \\nServices  (in  short  GTFS)  and  as  per  terms  of  agreement  GTFS  finds  prospective \\ncustomers through its net work on behalf of assessee and those customers will in turn \\npurchase insurance policy from RLICL.  During FY 2008-09, assessee paid an amount \\nof  Rs.94,41,57,368/-  and  the  bifurcation  of  this  payment  is  Rs.59,11,97,368/-  as \\noperating expenses and Rs.35,29,60,000/- as service charges.  The assessee deducted \\nTDS  on  total  payment  @  2%  considering  the  nature  of  payments  as  contractual \\npayments  under  the  provisions  of  section  194C  of  the  Act.  The  AO  during  survey \\nnoticed  that  the  payments  are  in  the  nature  of  insurance  commission  and  for  the \\npurpose of TDS the same falls under the provisions of section 194D of the Act thereby \\nassessee  is  liable  to  deduct  TDS  @  20%.    Accordingly,  the  AO  issued  show  cause \\nnotice  post  survey  and  thereby  computed  differential/short  deduction  of  TDS  at \\nRs.10,69,73,029/-  and  interest  chargeable  u/s.  201(1A)  of  the  Act  at  Rs.78,21,509/-, \\nthereby the AO made assessment u/s. 201(1) and 201(1A) of the Act. This assessment \\nwas accepted by assessee and no appeal was filed against quantum addition.  However, \\nthe AO initiated penalty proceedings u/s. 271C of the Act for short deduction of TDS \\nu/s. 194D of the Act on insurance commission. Before Addl. CIT (TDS) the assessee \\ncontended  that  as  per  written  agreement  between  the  assessee  and  GTFS  dated \\n01.08.2008  these  are  contractual  payments  because  the  assessee  is  acting  as  a  pure \\nagent of GTFS.  After that, in term of contractual payments, the assessee deducted TDS \\n@ 2% under the provisions of section 194C of the Act and assessee does not fall under \\nthe  provisions  of  section  194D of  the  Act  being  insurance agent.    According  to  Ld. \\nCounsel, the payments are not in the nature of insurance commission rather these are \\ncontractual receipts but the AO i.e. Addl. CIT (TDS) has not accepted the explanation \\nof  the  assessee  and  levied  penalty  for  short  deduction  of  tax  to  the  tune  of \\nRs.8,80,89,883/-.  Aggrieved, assessee preferred appeal before CIT(A).  \\n \\n4. \\nThe CIT(A) after considering the submissions of the assessee and various case \\nlaws deleted the penalty by treating the payments as contractual receipts.  The CIT(A) \\nconcluded  that  due  to  reasonable  cause the assessee  failed  to  deduct  TDS under  the \\nprovisions of  section 194D of  the  Act  being reimbursement of  expenses  and  service \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n3 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\n \\ncharges paid to GTFS due to bona fide views.  Aggrieved, now revenue is in second \\nappeal before Tribunal.  \\n\\n5.  We have heard rival submissions and gone through facts and circumstances of \\nthe case.  Before us, Ld. Counsel for the assessee Shri R. N. Bajoria, Sr. Advocate, first \\nof  all, drew out attention  to  the  agreement  entered  into between  assessee  and  GTFS \\ndated 01.08.2008 wherein assessee disclosed it as an agency company and pure agent is \\nthe GTFS and life insurance company is Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd.  Ld. Counsel \\nfor  the  assessee  drew  our  attention  to  page  2  of  the  agreement  wherein  the  agency \\ncompany  i.e.  the  assessee  agreed  to  appoint  GTFS  as  pure  agent  for  the  following \\npurposes. The relevant purposes are mentioned in the agreement, which reads as under:  \\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(i)Procurement of prospect for insurance business on account of the Agency Company \\nby utilizing the services of the Network. \\n (ii) Payment of incentive / other expenses/ service charges / to the Network on behalf of \\nthe Agency Company for the prospect of insurance business procured by the Network on \\naccount of the Agency Company. \\n(iii) Authorising the Golden Trust Financial Services to make payment to the Network \\nfor the prospect of insurance business procured by the Network on behalf of the Agency \\nCompany.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nLd.    Counsel  for  the  assessee  also  drew  our  attention  to  Article-1  of  the  agreement \\nwherein  the  infrastructure  and  obligation  of  various  parties  are  mentioned.    The \\ninfrastructure and obligation reads as under: \\n\\n \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cARTICLE 1 : THE INFRASTRUCTURE : \\n\\n1.1. \\n\\nThe Infrastructure of Golden Trust Financial Services is in a position to provide \\nnecessary  assistance  to  the  Company  to  enable  it  to  carry  on  the  Agency \\nBusiness.  \\n\\n1.2.

Counsel for the assessee stated that the assessee has to reimburse \\nthe expenses of GTFS in its capacity as pure agent of the Agency Company on account \\nof  payment  of  incentives,  other  expenses  and  service  charges  etc.  According  to  Ld. \\nCounsel, GTFS shall be reimbursed for the incentive and other expenses paid by it to \\nthe  network  as  pure  agent  of  the  Agency  Company  for  procuring  prospectus  of  the \\ninsurance business by the network on behalf of the Agency Company.  Similarly, Ld. \\nCounsel by passing reference drew our attention to payment of remunerations also of \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\n \\nRs.  2  cr.  to  GTFS  from  August,  2008  to  Marc,  2009.    Even  for  making  available \\nnecessary  services  of  infrastructure,  the  assessee  was  under  obligation  to  make \\npayment  to  GTFS  amounting  to  Rs.2  cr.  from  the  Agency  company  for  the  same \\nperiod.    In  term  of  the  above,  Ld.  Counsel  for  the  assessee  stated  that  there  is  no \\nelement  of  insurance  commission  to  be  received  or  to  be  paid  rather  this  is  only \\ncontractual  obligation  between  assessee  and  the  Agency  Company.    When  this  was \\npointed  out to  the Ld.  Counsel  for  the assessee by  the  Bench  that how  this  is  to be \\ntreated  as  contractual  obligation  and not  insurance  commission,  Ld.  Counsel  for  the \\nassessee stated that an expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion was taken qua this proposition by the assessee \\nand one Advocate Shri Chandan Dutta delivered his opinion dated 05.11.2008 wherein \\nafter considering the agreement entered into between the assessee and GTFS, he opined \\nthat  GTFS  was  appointed  to  carry  out  certain  work  on  behalf  of  the  assessee  in \\npursuance  of  a  contract  and  accordingly,  the  payments  by  assessee  to  GTFS  for \\ncarrying  out  the  aforesaid  work  falls  within  the  ambit  of  contractual  obligation  and \\nconsequently, TDS is to be deducted u/s. 194C of the Act i.e. payments to contractors.  \\nLd. Counsel for the assessee in view of the above opinion referred to the case law of \\nHon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble Gujarat High court in the case of ITO Vs. Sachinam Trust (2010) 320 ITR 445 \\n(Guj)  wherein  the  Tax  Audit  Manual  published  by  Bombay  Chartered  Accountants \\nSociety, contained the opinion of eminent counsel that in the case of a person carrying \\non  banking  business,  the  appropriate  expression  to  be  considered  for  deciding  the \\napplicability of the provisions of section 44AB of the Act would be on the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgross \\nreceipts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  on  the  basis  of  this  opinion,  Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble  Gujarat  High  Court  deleted  the \\npenalty by treating the same as reasonable cause by observing as under: \\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn  the circumstances,  without  entering  into  the  analysis  of  the  provisions of section \\n44AB of the Act, for the purpose of determining whether in the case of money-lender, \\nturnover  would  constitute  the  basis  for  invoking  the  said  provision  or  gross  receipts \\nwould constitute the basis for applying the said provision, the appeal is decided on the \\nground as to whether the assessee had a bona fide belief which constituted reasonable \\ncause in the facts and circumstances of the case. Under the provisions of section 273B \\nof the Act, the Legislature has provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the \\nprovisions of section 271B of the Act, no penalty shall be imposable on a person or an \\nassessee for any failure referred to in the said provisions if it is proved that there was \\nreasonable cause for the said failure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n \\n\\n7. \\nLd. Counsel for the assessee then drew our attention to the decision of Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble \\nSupreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) P. Ltd. (2009) 312 ITR \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n6 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\n \\n225 (SC) that the penalty u/s. 271C of the Act is not automatic and reasonable cause \\nwill waive the penalty in case the assessee is able to prove the same.  Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble Supreme  \\nCourt has discussed the scope of section 271C read with section 273B of the Act and \\nheld that in case the assessee is in a genuine and bona fide belief that it was not under \\nobligation to deduct tax penalty u/s. 271C of the Act cannot levied and for this, Ld. \\nCounsel for the assessee referred to para 36 at page 251 of the report, which reads as \\nunder: \\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(iv) On the scope of section 271C read with section 273B: \\n Section 271C, inter alia, states that if any person fails to deduct the whole or any part \\nof the tax as required by the provisions of Chapter XVII-B then such person shall be \\nliable to pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to the amount of tax which such person \\nfailed to deduct. In these cases we are concerned with section 271C(1)(a). Thus, section \\n271C(1)(a) makes it clear that the penalty leviable shall be equal to the amount of tax \\nwhich such person failed to deduct. We cannot hold this provision to be mandatory or \\ncompensatory or  automatic  because  under section  273B  Parliament  has  enacted  that \\npenalty  shall  not  be  imposed  in  cases  falling  there  under.  Section  271C  falls  in  the \\ncategory of such cases. Section 273B states that notwithstanding anything contained in \\nsection 271C, no penalty shall be imposed on the person or the assessee for failure to \\ndeduct tax at source if such person or the assessee proves that there was a reasonable \\ncause for the said failure. Therefore, the liability to levy of penalty can be fastened only \\non persons who do not have good and sufficient reason for not deducting tax at source. \\nOnly those persons will be liable to penalty who do not have good and sufficient reason \\nfor not deducting the tax. The burden, of course, is on the person to prove such good \\nand sufficient reason. In each of the 104 cases before us, we find that non-deduction of \\ntax  at  source  took  place  on  account  of  controversial  addition.  The  concept  of \\naggregation or consolidation of the entire income chargeable under the head \"Salaries\" \\nbeing exigible to deduction of tax at source under section 192 was a nascent issue. It \\nhas not been considered by this court before. Further, in most of these cases, the tax \\ndeductor-assessee has not claimed deduction under section 40(a)(iii) in computation of \\nits  business  income.  This is  one  more  reason  for  not  imposing  penalty  under  section \\n271C because by not claiming deduction under section 40(a)(iii), in some cases, higher \\ncorporate tax has been paid to the extent of Rs. 906.52 lakhs (see Civil Appeal No. 1778 \\nof  2006  entitled  CIT  v.  Bank  of  Tokyo-Mitsubishi  Ltd.).  In  some  of  the  cases,  it  is \\nundisputed that each of the expatriate employees have paid directly the taxes due on the \\nforeign  salary  by  way  of  advance  tax/self-assessment  tax.  The  tax-deductor-assessee \\nwas under a genuine and bona fide belief that it was not under any obligation to deduct \\ntax  at  source  from  the  home  salary  paid  by  the  foreign  company/head  office  and, \\nconsequently,  we  are  of  the  view  that  in  none  of  the  104  cases  penalty  was  leviable \\nunder  section  271C  as  the  respondent  in  each  case  has  discharged  its  burden  of \\nshowing reasonable cause for failure to deduct tax at source.\" \\n\\n8. \\nLd. Sr. Dr, however, relied on the decision of Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble Kerala High Court in the \\ncase of CIT Vs. Mr. Thomas Muthoot, ITA No. 139 of 2013( arising out of order in \\nITA  No.  385/Coch/2011 of  I.T.A.  Tribunal  ,  Cochin Bench dated 11.01.2013) dated \\n03.07.2015 and stated that merely good and sufficient reasons asked by the assessee \\ncannot be the basis for deletion of penalty and it cannot be a plea that the assessee firm \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n7 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\n \\nhas returned loss and not liable to pay any tax in view of the decision of Hindustan \\nCoca Cola Beverage (P) Ltd. Vs. CIT (2007) 293 ITR 226 (SC).  When a query was \\nput to ld. Sr. DR that there is no reasonable cause argued in the case of Mr. Thomas \\nMuthoot, supra of Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble Kerala High court but only issue was whether merely the \\nother party has included the receipts in their income and paid taxes, will absolve the \\nassessee from the rigors of provision of section 194C or sec. 194D of the Act i.e. the \\nTDS provisions.  The Ld. Sr. DR could not reply on this.  He also relied on the decision \\nof Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble Supreme Court in the case of Mak Data P. Ltd. Vs. CIT (2013) 358 ITR \\n593 (SC) and also Union of India & Ors. Vs. Dharmendra Textiles Processors & Ors. \\n(2008) 306 ITR 277 (SC), wherein willful concealment is not an essential ingredient \\nfor  attracting  civil  liability.    Ld.  Sr.  DR  was  again  asked  whether  the  decisions  of \\nDharmendra Textiles Processor, supra and Mak Data P. Ltd., supra have been diluted \\nin the case of T. Ashok Pai Vs. CIT (2007) 292 ITR 11 (SC).  Ld. Sr. DR also stated \\nthat  the  opinion  of  the  Advocate  was  not  available  before  the  AO  at  the  time  of \\nassessment  of  tax.    On  this,  Ld.  Counsel  for  the  assessee  stated  that  the  entire \\nagreement was referred to by the AO during penalty proceedings and the clauses of the \\nagreement  are  verbatim  reproduced  in  the  same.    Now  question  arises,  whether  the \\nshort  deduction  of  TDS  u/s.  194D  of  the  Act  treating  the  payments  as  contractual \\nreceipts u/s. 194C of the Act, in the given facts and  circumstances as above, attracts \\npenalty  u/s.  271C  of  the  Act  or  not.  The  facts  above  narrated  are  undisputed.  The \\nassessee has made payments treating the same as contractual payments in lieu of the \\nagreement  after  obtaining  opinion  from  the  advocate.  There  is  no  dispute  that  the \\nassessee has deducted tax u/s. 194C of the Act for contractual payment on the basis of \\nthe  opinion  of  advocate  and  this  is  also  not  under  dispute  that  the  deductions  were \\nrequired  to  be  made  by  the  assessee  u/s. 194D  of  the  Act  from  the  payments  being \\nmade by the assessee either reimbursement of expenses or payments being contractual \\nor commission income.  Once there is advice from an expert, assessee has to rely on it \\nand  this  constitutes  a  reasonable  cause.    Hon\\xe2\\x80\\x99ble  Delhi  High  Court  in  the  case  of \\nWoodward Governor India P. Ltd. Vs. CIT (2002) 253 ITR 745 (Del) has dealt with \\nthe issue of reasonable cause as mentioned in section 273B of the Act as under: \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLevy  of  penalty  under  section  271C  is  not  automatic.  Before  levying  penalty,  the \\nconcerned officer is required to find out that even if there was any failure referred to in \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n8 \\n \\n\\nITA  No.1939/K/2010  \\nM/s. Height Insurance Services Ltd. AY  2009-10 \\n\\nthe concerned provision the same was without a reasonable cause. The initial burden is \\non the assessed to show that there existed reasonable cause which was the reason for \\nthe failure referred to in the concerned provision. Thereafter the officer dealing with the \\nmatter has to consider whether the Explanation offered by the assessee or the person, \\nas the case may be, as regards the reason for failure, was on account of reasonable \\ncause. \"Reasonable cause\" as applied to human action is that which would constrain a \\nperson  of  average  intelligence  and  ordinary  prudence.  It  can  be  described  as  a \\nprobable  cause.  It  means  an  honest  belief  founded  upon  reasonable  grounds,  of  the \\nexistence  of  a  state  of  circumstances,  which  assuming  them  to  be  true,  would \\nreasonably lead any ordinary prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the \\nperson concerned, to come to the conclusion that same was the right thing to do. The \\ncause  shown  has  to  be  considered  and  only  if  it  is  found  to  be  frivolous,  without \\nsubstance or foundation, the prescribed consequences will follow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\nThe advice of the expert i.e. advocate after going through the clauses of the agreement \\nholding the same as contractual obligation may be ill conceived advice but assessee has \\nno option except to believe the same. Accordingly, in view of facts and circumstances \\nof the case, we are of the view that the CIT(A) has rightly deleted the penalty and we \\nconfirm the same.  Appeal of revenue is dismissed.  \\n\\n9. \\n\\nIn the result, the appeal of revenue is dismissed. \\n\\n10.

AO asked the assessee to explain as to why the amount of Commission / Brokerage should not be disallowed as no Tax has been deducted by way of TDS.After considering the submissions of the assessee  AO held that any person who was responsible for paying to a resident any income by way of commission/brokerage had to deduct Income Tax thereon,that the assessee had made payment of commission of Rs. 69,09,863 to Citi Bank,HSBC and American Express Bank without deduction of TDS in violation of  the provisions of section 194 H of the Act, that  according to the provisions contained in Sec.40(a)(ia) of the Act any interest/Commission/Brokerage/rent/royalty/fees for professional services or fees for technical services payable to a resident or amounts payable to a contractor or sub-contractor,being resident, for carrying out any work  tax had to be deducted,that assessee  had not  paid the deducted tax during the previous year or in the subsequent year before the expiry of the time prescribed u/s.200(1) of the Act. Finally,he held that Rs.69,09,863/- had to be disallowed u/s. 40(a)(ia)of the Act.2.1.Against the order of the AO assessee preferred an appeal before the First Appeal Authority (FAA).After considering the submissions of the assessee and the assessment order he held that assessee had entered into a professional services contractual agreement with DLC, that DLC was in business of providing and management of professional manpower leasing services,that DLC was to provide Date Entry Operators (DEOs) and Computer Operators (COs)for the work of the assessee company, that DEOs and COs were expected to be 10+2 pass out with 2-3 years of Diploma/Data Entry Experience, that they were supposed to have knowledge of Windows Operat -ing System and working knowledge of Scanners, that the contract between the two companies was not for supply of general labour for manual work, that DEOs and COs were deployed by the company to render technical services, that payment of Rs. 2.42 Crores paid by the assessee to DLC was essentially fees for technical services,that in the agreement word professional services contractual agreement had been mentioned.After discussing explanation 2 clause (vii) of sub-section 1 of section 9 of the Act, he held that technical services included any managerial/ techni -cal /consultancy services,that the DLC had provided the services of technical staff,that DEOs and COs were paid money by the assessee company that was in the nature of technical services,that provisions of section 194J(1) of the Act were applicable on the facts and circumstances of the case for deduction of TDS, that the argument of the assessee that TDS was required to be deducted u/s 194C of the Act was devoid of any merit.He further found that as per the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) tax deductible at source by the assessee company u/s 119J was Rs. 24.29 lacs because it had paid Rs. 2.42 Crores to DLC, that it had deducted TDS of Rs. 6.08 lacs only, that AO had correctly allowed the expenses to the extent of Rs. 60.83 lacs, that assessee had deducted TDS to that extent only,that remaining sum of Rs. 1.82 Crores had been paid by the company to DLC without deduction of TDS,that provisions of section 40(a)(ia) were clearly applicable in the case under consideration,that TDS had not been deducted by the assessee-company in part/full by making the payment to DLC,that expenditure could not be allowed as per the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act. Finally,he upheld the addition made by the AO amounting to Rs. 1.82 crore. 2.2.Before us,Authorised Representative (AR) submitted that assessee had entered into an agreement with labour contractor, that it had deducted TDS @ 2% as per the provisions of section 194C of the Act, that section 194J was not applicable in the case under consideration. He referred to Page No.37,40, 55, 60, 62-63, 92 of the paper book. Referring to the agreement, he submitted that from the job description of the persons employed it was evident that the contract in question was labour contract.He further stated that even if the provisions of section 194J of the Act were applicable mere short deduction of TDS would not lead to invoking of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act. He relied upon the order of the Kochin Bench delivered on 29.05.2013 in the case of Appolo Tyer Ltd.(ITA No9. 31/Koch/2010 AY 2006-07).Departmental Representative (DR) submitted that the agreement entered between the assessee and DLC was not for supplying labours, that DLC has rendered professional services to the assessee.She referred to Page No. 2 and 42 of the Paper Book.It was further submitted by the DR that the assessee had deducted TDS amounting to Rs. 6 lacs only,that it was not a case of short deduction of tax but a case where no tax was deducted at all. 2.3.We have heard the rival submissions and perused the material before us in case under consideration.An agreement was entered into between assessee and DLC and as per that agree -ment DLC had to carry out the specific job for the assessee. From the agreement it is clear that DEOs and the Cos had to perform particular functions as per the requirements of the asssessee.They had to scan the documents besides carrying out the job of Bar Coding of the papers.As per the agreement, minimum qualification to do the job of Scanning/Bar Coding was diploma course after passing 12th standard,as mentioned at paragraph no.2.1.We are of the opinion that work done by these operators(DEOs/Cos) cannot termed as labour work.For Bar Coding and other related activities a minimum professional qualification and proficiency is required.In these circumstances, work done by the operators has to be treated as technical service and provision of section 194J would be attracted to the payment made to them by the assessee company.We find that Kochin Bench of ITAT has dealt the issue of non-deduction/short deduction of TDS with respect to section 40(a)(ia) of the Act in the case of Appolo Tyer Ltd.  (supra). While deciding the issue it had referred to the maters of S.K. Tekriwal, delivered by the Hon’ble High Court of Kolkata and Chanda Bhoy and Jasso Bhoy (14 SOT 448-Mum). Refering to the case of of Chanda Bhoy and Jasso Bhoy (supra) Kochin bench had observed as under: “The Mumbai Bench found that short deduction of TDS, if any, could have been considered as liability under the Income-tax Act as due from the assessee. Therefore, the disallowance of the entire expenditure, whose genuineness was not doubted by the assessing officer is not justified”. Kochin Bench had also held that in case of short/lesser deduction of tax, the entire expenditure whose genuineness was not doubted by the AO, could not be disallowed. In our opinion, considering these orders, in the interest of justice, mater should be remitted back to the filed by the AO for fresh adjudication to decide the issue afresh.He is directed to afford reasonable opportunity of hearing to the assessee to decide the issue afresh,after considering the orders of Appolo Tyer Ltd. (supra) and Chanda Bhoy and Jasso Bhoy (supra).                               As a result,appeal filed by the assesee stands partly allowed.     परिणामतः निर्धारिती द्वारा दाखिल की गई अपील आंशिक रूप से मंजूर की जाती है.
